# Emoji Git

## Commit Messages

Use imperative mood and prepend a semantic emoji. Keep the subject line under 72 characters. Add a body only when extra context is genuinely useful.

**Format:** `<emoji> <short imperative description>`

| Emoji | When to use                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✨    | Introduce a new feature                        |
| 🐛    | Fix a bug                                      |
| ♻️    | Refactor existing code without behavior change |
| 📦    | Add, update, or remove packages/dependencies   |
| 🎨    | Improve code structure, formatting, or style   |
| 🔧    | Add or update configuration files              |
| 📝    | Add or update documentation or copy            |
| 🔖    | Publish a release                              |

**Examples:**

```
✨ Add dark mode toggle to settings page
🐛 Fix null reference on empty cart checkout
♻️ Extract auth logic into useAuth hook
📦 Upgrade react to v19
🎨 Sort imports and remove unused variables
🔧 Add eslint rule for no-console
📝 Update README with local dev setup steps
🔖 Publish v0.1.1
```

## Branch Names

Use lowercase kebab-case. Prefix with the type of work followed by a slash.

**Format:** `<type>/<short-description>`

| Prefix      | When to use           |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `feature/`  | New feature           |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix               |
| `refactor/` | Code refactor         |
| `chore/`    | Config, deps, tooling |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only    |
| `release/`  | Release publishing    |

**Examples:**

```
feature/dark-mode-toggle
fix/cart-null-reference
refactor/auth-hook
chore/upgrade-react-v19
docs/local-dev-setup
release/v0.1.1
```

## Pull Requests

PR titles inherit from the branch name: use the emoji that matches the branch prefix, then the branch description in sentence case (kebab-case → Sentence case).

**Format:** `<emoji> <Branch name in sentence case>`

| Branch prefix | Emoji |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `feature/`    | ✨    |
| `fix/`        | 🐛    |
| `refactor/`   | ♻️    |
| `chore/`      | 🔧    |
| `docs/`       | 📝    |
| `release/`    | 🔖    |

**Examples:**

| Branch                     | PR title               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `feature/dark-mode-toggle` | ✨ Dark mode toggle    |
| `fix/cart-null-reference`  | 🐛 Cart null reference |
| `refactor/auth-hook`       | ♻️ Auth hook           |
| `release/v0.1.1`           | 🔖 Release v0.1.1      |

PR bodies must include a summary of the changes. Describe what was done and why.

## Releases

Every release bumps the version. The `ship` skill runs `npm version patch` (or `minor`/`major` if specified) before pushing, so each release PR includes a version commit and tag.
