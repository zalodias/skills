description: Code style, naming, and formatting conventions for TypeScript and React projects. Use when writing TypeScript, creating React components, applying Tailwind styles, naming files, variables, or functions, or making any code style decisions.

# Code Style

## Naming

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories and files (`components/auth-wizard`)
- Prefer single-word names in variables, functions, types, and components
- Never abbreviate — write `button` not `btn`, `error` not `err`
- Favor named exports for components
- Prefix event handlers with `handle` (`handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)
- Prefix boolean variables with a verb (`isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`)

## TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define components with the `function` keyword
- Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
- Use absolute imports with the `@` alias (`@/components/button`)

## Formatting

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions
- Omit semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
- Use declarative JSX
- Avoid code comments

## Tokens

- Do not create new global design tokens or CSS variables unless explicitly asked
- Prefer reusing existing tokens and utilities; if a new token feels necessary, ask first

## Styling

- Use TailwindCSS for all styling; keep utility classes inline
- Use the project design system and CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Spacing

- Use a `4px` spacing grid for layout, padding, and margins
- Prefer `gap` over `margin` for layout and inner-element spacing

## Motion

- Use animation and transition timing in `0.04s` increments (e.g. `0.12s`, `0.16s`, `0.2s`)

## Components

- Only extract a component when it is used (or likely to be used) in more than one place. Keep single-use UI sections inline.
